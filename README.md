Simple Explanation of Linear and Logistic Regression
1. Linear Regression

Linear regression in machine learning is a way to predict a number based on other
related numbers. It finds a straight-line relationship between variables.
o House Rent Prediction: Estimating rent based on house size, number of rooms
and age of the house.
o Gas Pay Prediction: Estimating how much you will pay per how many
kilometer you driven.

2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used when we want to put things into categories, like "Yes or
No" answers. Instead of predicting a number, it predicts the probability of something
happening.
o Work Experience to getting promoted.
o Study hours to success in exams.

Objective of the Project and Code Explaination
In this project, we estimate the rent using linear regression based on the house datas we have
and the house variables to be entered by the user, and analyze whether this estimate is
affordable according to the budget entered by the user.
